# Rainfall Prediction Project

Welcome to the Rainfall Prediction Project, a powerful Machine Learning solution designed to forecast rainfall with precision. Our project leverages techniques, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to provide reliable weather predictions.

## Problem Statement

Fluctuating weather patterns and the need for water resource optimization make accurate rainfall prediction crucial. Our project contributes to disaster preparedness, agriculture, and community well-being.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive dataset with 23 weather attributes.
- Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and managing outliers.
- Effective imputation strategies for continuous, discrete, and categorical attributes.
- Custom label encoding for enhanced model understanding.
- XGBoost model selected as the top performer.
- Web application integration using Python Flask.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the web application with `python app.py`.
